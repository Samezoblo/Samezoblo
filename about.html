Samezoblo in Georgian language means neighborhood or more literally the place where the courtyards are. 

</p>

<p> 

The zine is an unconventional mode of representation of city ecologies. <br>
It provides a foreign perspective on casual city life, its objects, and peculiarities, 
which became normal for the local eyes. <br> Samezoblo reminds us, that each urban environment is unique
and that uniqueness should be appreciated or preserved. <br>
The zine documents objects, which comprise a great part of everyday culture, but will never be officially preserved <br> as a cultural heritage. <br> In this regard Samezoblo acts as an informal repository of such objects, which will be telling a story of NOW through years, spanning geographical borders.
